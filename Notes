        Host doesn't need to send move confirmation
    Client needs to send move requests
    Host needs to recieve move requests

How to send boardstate
    Could just send each tile
    Could send instructions to recreate the board
        Then add the pieces
        Struggles with non-piece changes
            Like selected square colors and highlighted colors
    

Standardize variable size to send over info better
