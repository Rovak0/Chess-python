# Python Chess

This is an offline chess game.  It is built in python and uses the Pygame library.  This was far more for practice in coding for python than for making a playable game of chess, so some obvious things are missing.  
To start the game, run the chessRunner.py file (open the file, right click anywhere and select the run python, run in terminal option).  

## Pieces
The pieces are color coded, but not by side, just by type.  When a piece is selected, all tiles that piece could move to are highlighted.  

## Usage
To select a piece, click on its tile.  To select a tile, also click on the tile.  To deselect a tile, click on it again.  To move a piece, select it, then select a legal move.  Once 2 tiles are selected, the piece will be moved.
